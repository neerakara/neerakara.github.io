I am a PhD student in the [Biomedical Image Computing group](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/research.html) at the [Computer Vision Institute](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html). My supervisor is [Prof. Ender Konukoglu](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~kender/).

### Research Area

The main objective of my PhD research is to tackle distribution shifts in machine learning, in the context of medical image analyses. Distribution shifts are a hindrance in virtually all machine learning methods and for several kinds of analyses, ranging from image segmentation, image classification, image enhancement to anomaly detection. In particular, the performance of the otherwise highly successful deep learning methods is also substantially marred in the face of such shifts.

In our research, we attempt to tackle this issue within two paradigms - those of domain generalization and continual machine learning. In traditional machine learning, the notion of generalization refers to achieving comparable performance in training and test data, both sampled from the same distribution. Domain generalization extends this notion, and requires good performance even when the distribution of the test images differs (upto _some degree_) from that of the training images. The idea in continual or lifelong machine learning is to learn multiple tasks sequentially, with effective knowledge transfer across tasks and while avoiding forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. I believe that these learning paradigms are highly desirable in several practical applications. They are especially suitable for medical image analyses to deal with challenges such as small-sized annotated datasets, data privacy concerns and the ubiquitous distributions shifts due to rapidly changing imaging protocols.

### Short Bio
---
I obtained a B.Tech. in Engineering Design and a M.Tech. in Biomedical Design in the land of dosas and super-inflated rickshaw prices (from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/)) in 2013. I was fortunate to be awarded a medal for the best academic performance in the department in my junior year. After this, I did embedded software development for about two years in the land of vada pavs and (un)disciplined scooter drivers (at the [Philips Healthcare Innovation Center in Pune, India](https://www.philips.com/a-w/asiapac/careers/healthtech/locations/india/healthcare-innovation-centre.html)). In 2015, I returned to academia and obtained a M.Sc. in Biomedical Imaging in the land of fondue and black money (from [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html)). I started my ongoing PhD at ETH Zurich in July 2017. In my free time, I like to hike, play chess, practice yoga and meditate.
